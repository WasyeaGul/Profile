# Personal Profile Website

## Description
This repository contains a **personal profile website** created as part of a school project. The project focused on selecting a website framework and customizing it to create a personal online profile.

Using the provided framework, I edited the website by reviewing the existing code and adjusting elements such as images, colors, layout, and text content. The goal of the project was to understand how changes in the code are reflected on the live website and to become familiar with basic website structure and deployment.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Cisco Secure Client (VPN access)
- VSL (school-provided environment)
- GitHub (version control)

## What I Learned
- How to navigate and understand an existing website codebase
- How to modify HTML and CSS to update visual elements
- How to upload and manage website files in a secure environment
- How changes in code affect the appearance and behavior of a website

## Notes
This project was completed for an academic course and demonstrates foundational exposure to web development concepts rather than advanced programming or analytics.
